Automated Smart Management Workshop: Configuring the Lab Environment
====================================================================

Objective
---------
The objective of this exercise is to setup the lab environemnt following an Infrastructure as Code process. This exercise will require you to launch (9) playbooks. The playbooks accomplish the following:

-   Populate Ansible Controller with an inventory source, add templates, as well as an additional project.
-   Publish RHEL7 dev content view in Satellite
-   Register servers to the Satellite installation - RHEL7
-   Register servers to the Satellite installation - CentOS7
-   Populate dynamic inventories - RHEL7
-   Populate dynamic inventories - CentOS7

> **NOTE** To save time, Satellite will already have a job executed that configures the proper lifecycle environments, content views, activation keys.

#### 3\. Dynamic inventories - understanding inventories populated via dynamic sources

> **NOTE** Before running the dynamic inventory update templates in the upcoming steps, first navigate to the Inventories location in AAP and review the following inventories:
>
>     - ALL Development => Hosts
>     - CentOS7 Development => Hosts
>     - RHEL7 Development => Hosts
>      
>    Note that these inventories have yet to be populated.  Also, while you are in each of these inventories, click on the "Sources" button and review how each of these dynamic source inventories are configured, taking note of the "SOURCE VARIABLES" section to gain an understanding on how the resultant hosts and groups for that particular inventory are populated.

Next, go back to Templates and run the **CONTROLLER / Update inventories via dynamic sources** job template by clicking the ![launch](images/0-setup-aap2-launch.png) to launch.

-   You will be presented with a survey. Fill this out as follows:
